Use when a template release must reach the fleet, when auditing all generated projects for a shared defect, or when applying a docs/config convention everywhere.

# Fan Out To Packages

Roll a change out to every package generated from this template. One agent per repo,
in parallel, each owning exactly one clone.

**The governing fact: this fleet fails silently.** Copier overwrites local files with
no conflict and no `.rej`. Docs markers that resolve to nothing render nothing.
Hook-emitted links are invisible to `--strict`. Almost every real defect found in this
fleet was invisible in a green build, and almost every *first* measurement of it was
wrong. Plan for that or the fan-out reports success and ships damage.

## 1. The fleet

Seven repos in `stateful-y`, all generated from this template (verify with
`.copier-answers.yml` `_src_path`). `internal`, `kedro-dagster-example`,
`staged-recipes` and `website` are **not** generated and must never be included.

Every repo is a `src/<package>/` layout. Nothing in this fleet is flat, so
`_get_root_members`' hardcoded `src/<pkg>` path is inert here — a genuinely flat repo
would get a silent empty return from it, but none exists yet.

| repo | `include_examples` | what makes it different |
|---|---|---|
| **yohou** | True | The reference implementation and the biggest: ~79 notebooks in **7** groups (6 `examples/` subdirs plus top-level `quickstart.py`), 46 companion pages, 6 curated section pages, hand-written See Also bullets, a 35-link how-to index grouped under 8 headings. It **deleted the seed how-tos** (`contribute.md`, `troubleshooting.md`) for 36 curated ones, so any release touching those is inert here. The only repo that `select`s ruff's `D`, so it is the only one that sees a docstring defect in a template-owned file. Its docs are the quality bar — do not "normalise" them without a reason. |
| yohou-nixtla | True | 2 notebooks. Its logos were destroyed by a past update and restored from `f166f46`; **never touch `docs/assets/`**. `_base.py` is `_`-prefixed, so `BaseNixtlaForecaster` reached the API only once `_get_root_members` landed (17→18 rows). Answers cap at `max_python_version: 3.13` — scipy ships no cp314 wheel. Known-flagged: inert `environments` key under `[tool.coverage.report]`, `lightning_logs` xdist race, `/en/stable/` 404 (no stable release yet). |
| yohou-optuna | True | 5 notebooks, all flat. Carries **15 custom skills / 36 files** under `.claude/skills/` that must stay tracked. (`plot_model_comparison_bar` is **yohou's**, not this repo's — an earlier version of this table said otherwise.) |
| sklearn-wrap | True | 9 flat notebooks. `--extra config` is needed for **`ty`** and for **notebook execution during export**, but *not* for rendering: `check_docs` passes with pydantic absent because mkdocstrings uses griffe's static analysis. So `build_docs`/`build_steps` fail locally on `examples/yaml_config.py` while CI and RTD stay green — RTD's recipe passes the extra, the nox sessions never got it (`test_docstrings` already does, so the pattern exists locally). Pre-existing, verified identical on the prior tag. An earlier version of this table said the extra was "not for the docs build", full stop; that is wrong for the export leg. `test_docstrings` has **no matrix parametrization** here — a single ubuntu job on 3.11 — so do not go looking for one to preserve. Went RTD-red once from the v0.22.0 gallery bug. |
| sklearn-optuna | True | 9 flat notebooks. **See Also: 13 sections, 32 entries, 0 unlinked** — that is the whole useful fact. Do *not* re-add a breakdown of where those links point: this cell has carried three mutually contradictory versions (dependency-inventory resolution; 21 external to `docs.python.org`; 21 internal + 9 API + 2 external), each written confidently from a single agent's measurement, and a spot-check of a live page found 3 links all internal. Nothing in a fan-out turns on the answer. Carries `Sampler`/`Storage`, whose only member is `__init__` — filtered out — which makes it the fleet's test case for anything sensitive to *rendered* vs declared members. |
| **kedro-dagster** | **False** | No notebooks. Largest docstring surface (~126 See Also links). `docstring_options: {warn_unknown_params: false}` is **CI-critical** — flipping it emits 77 griffe warnings and now *fails* the build. Snippets `base_path` must stay `[docs, .]`: it includes repo-root-relative `src/kedro_dagster/templates/*`. `datasets/` re-export layout. Renamed its page to **`troubleshoot.md`**, and keeps a `test-versions` job (with its `needs:`) that copier has deleted before — it lives in **`nightly.yml:45`** and a dedicated **`tests-versions.yml`**, *not* in `tests.yml`; an agent grepping `tests.yml` per this file's old phrasing found nothing and briefly thought it had hit that exact loss. Its curated `pages/reference/datasets.md` is the fleet's only multi-object `:::` page, which makes it the sole real test for anything about duplicate ids or per-object section stripping. |
| **kedro-azureml-pipeline** | **False** | No notebooks. `warn_unknown_params: false` is CI-critical — measured to the number: flipping it produces exactly **46** griffe warnings and fails `--strict`. Its `inventories` is **the template default** (`docs.python.org` only), *not* a local extension — an earlier version of this table said it kept a local list, and an agent that went looking for one to preserve found nothing. `distributed/` re-export layout. Best index coverage in the fleet. Renamed its page to **`troubleshoot.md`**. `test_versions` matrix is recorded here as **12** sessions (3 py × 1 kedro × 2 azure-ai-ml × 2 mlflow), but a v0.28.1-round agent counted **10 jobs actually running** (4 on 3.11, 4 on 3.12, 2 on 3.13) with the workflows byte-identical before and after. Unresolved; pre-existing either way. Measure before relying on either number. Answers cap at `max_python_version: 3.13`, but `requires-python` has **no upper bound** — see the interpreter note in §5. |

**`include_examples: False` is real and load-bearing.** For those two repos the gallery,
companion-notebook and `GALLERY:section` machinery is Jinja-gated *out of their
`hooks.py` entirely*. Any release that only touches example machinery is genuinely inert
for them — verify by diffing the two pristine renders rather than assuming either way.
If an update tries to introduce example content or an `Examples` nav entry there, that is
a template bug: report it, do not accommodate it.

## 2. Before dispatching

1. **The release must be TAGGED, not merged.** "Latest" means the newest *tag*. A repo
   whose `_commit` is ahead of the newest tag cannot update at all — it fails as
   `Downgrades are not supported`, not as a no-op. Verify the tag resolves and actually
   contains the change:
   `git rev-list -n1 vX.Y.Z` and grep the changed file out of `git show vX.Y.Z:<path>`.
2. **Diff the two pristine renders across the version pair, per `include_examples` value.**
   This tells you what each repo will actually receive, and it is the only thing that makes
   a later "untouched!" result meaningful. Do it before writing the briefs.
3. **Write the per-repo briefs from THIS FILE, re-read now — not from working memory.**
   §1 is the corrected record; your recollection of it is a stale copy. In the v0.28.1 round
   I briefed kedro-azureml to "preserve its local `inventories` list" — a claim §1 already
   carried as *retracted*, with a note that an agent went looking and found nothing. The
   agent went looking again and found nothing again. Same for the root-export gap in §4,
   which I passed to an agent as an unfixed bug two releases after it was fixed. Both cost
   an agent real work, and both were one `grep` away. **A brief is a copy of this file's
   claims; copies drift.**
4. **Give each agent a scratch directory unique to its repo, and tell it to keep every file
   it writes inside that directory.** A unique directory is necessary but not sufficient:
   agents have still collided at the shared scratchpad root. One had a sibling overwrite its
   script mid-run, and the rewritten script cheerfully reported `LOST: NONE` — out of two
   empty lists. Another found a foreign script pointed at a different repo's clone and
   correctly refused to run it. Tell each agent to distrust any file it did not write.
5. **Do not assume the scratchpad is empty, and do not assume it is wiped.** It is *not*
   wiped between sessions — agents have found their previous clones intact, at the previous
   release's ref. That is the more dangerous direction: a stale clone updates from the wrong
   baseline and every later measurement is against a fiction. Have each agent clone fresh,
   and verify the ref it actually landed on rather than the ref it asked for. The work lives
   on GitHub, not on disk.
6. **Check where each repo's PR branch actually sits, not where `main` sits.** This fleet
   carries one long-lived `template-update/*` PR per repo whose branch name is frozen at the
   release that created it; the content advances every release while `main` stays behind. The
   branch name is not evidence of its version — read `_commit` from `.copier-answers.yml` on
   the branch and resolve it against the tag list.

## 3. What every repo must satisfy (the invariants)

- `docs/hooks.py` is **Tier 1** — take the clean render, never a merge. Verify it is
  byte-identical to a fresh `copier copy` at the same ref. All six historical forks were
  eliminated by v0.20.0 and must not come back.
- **`git diff --stat -- docs/assets` is empty.** The only sanctioned exception in this
  fleet's history is yohou-nixtla's 2-file logo restore.
- `nox -s check_docs` passes with **0 warnings** (it builds `--strict`, notebooks skipped).
- See Also: **0 unlinked**. The absolute count is a measurement artifact — see §5.
- Every index links every one of its sibling pages.
- CI: report **how many checks RAN**, not just how many failed.

### Docs conventions (as of v0.23.0)

| page | convention |
|---|---|
| `docs/index.md` (home) | grid cards, **tailored per package** — leave alone |
| `pages/examples/index.md` | sectioned cards (`<!-- GALLERY -->`, or inline `<!-- GALLERY:section:… -->` per section) |
| `pages/{tutorials,how-to,reference,explanation}/index.md` | a **text list** of subpages, each with a one-line description — *not* cards, *not* tables |
| `pages/reference/api.md` (or `pages/api/index.md`) | frontmatter + H1 + one intro paragraph + `<!-- API_TABLE -->`, nothing else |
| nav order | `Home > Tutorials > How-to Guides > Examples > Explanation > Reference` — **Reference last**; `Examples` present iff the package has notebooks |
| companion card | after the prerequisites (and after any install section), before the first body section |

Group a section index under `##` headings only when it is big enough to need it — yohou's
35 how-tos earn it; 8 do not.

## 4. The hazards, all of which have fired

**Copier destroys local content silently.**
- It **overwrites binaries every run**, regardless of diff — no conflict, no `.rej`, only a
  `Bin NNNN -> NNNN` line. This ate project logos for months. Only `_skip_if_exists`
  stops it; "Tier 3" is a convention for whoever *resolves* an update and is never reached.
- It applies an update as **a diff against the template's version**. Once a local file no
  longer resembles it, one shifted line rejects the whole hunk and the page reverts to the
  stub, content surviving only in a `.rej` nobody reads. A **whitespace-only** template
  change replaced a 244-line curated tutorial with a 74-line placeholder in one release.
- `_skip_if_exists` now covers the 4 logos, `docs/index.md`,
  `docs/pages/tutorials/getting-started.md` and `docs/pages/examples/index.md`.
- **`mkdocs.yml` is NOT protected, and a nav-touching release clobbers it every time.**
  Not a risk — a certainty. v0.26.0 removed one nav line and the clobber fired in **7 of 7**
  repos: 227 curated nav leaves collapsed to 87. Once a repo's nav has diverged, the hunk
  rejects as a unit and copier falls back to the pristine nav wholesale, leaving the real
  one in a single `.rej`. Per repo: yohou 95→12, kedro-azureml 29→11, kedro-dagster 25→11,
  sklearn-wrap 24→16, sklearn-optuna 21→13, yohou-optuna 17→12, yohou-nixtla 16→12.
  **Every single clobber preserved correct section order and kept `Reference` last**, and
  several also injected a `configure.md` the repo does not have — a red `--strict` build.
  Order-checking passes all seven. Total-count checking passes several. **Only per-section
  counts catch it**, from parsed YAML, recorded *before* the update. yohou went further and
  diffed leaf-by-leaf, which is what you want on a big nav.
  Resolution is always `git checkout HEAD -- mkdocs.yml`, then hand-apply only what the
  template genuinely changed — usually nothing, and prove that by diffing
  `template/mkdocs.yml.jinja` across the pair rather than assuming.
- A **`.rej` holds the PROJECT's own changes** that could not be re-applied — not the
  template's. That is why local content goes missing and every conflicted file is
  partially applied.
- **A `.rej` hunk that bundles a redundant change with load-bearing local work drops
  both, and the `.rej` count does not show it.** The unit of rejection is the hunk, not
  the line. yohou lost its `test_docstrings-${{ matrix.python-version }}` parametrization
  because the hunk also carried a now-redundant codecov bump — the bare session would have
  run 16 times against uninstalled interpreters. kedro-dagster lost its entire
  `test-versions` job and its `needs:` the same way, with no `.rej` of its own.
  yohou-optuna's `mkdocs.yml` hunk bundled the template's intended removal with 4 local
  entries: 5 vanished, the `.rej` showed 4. **Diff every touched file WHOLE-FILE against
  the pre-update baseline.** The update's own hunks always look innocent.
- **Every action pin must match what the fleet runs.** A pin the fleet does not run is not
  a stale version number: dependabot bumps the repo, so the gap becomes a permanent local
  delta copier replays on every release, and each replay is a chance to strand it. CI
  cannot catch it — the older version still works. v0.25.0 pinned `checkout` to the fleet's
  v7 and stopped there; the very next fan-out found the identical bug on `github-script` in
  four repos and `codecov` in another, because each repo's bump shared a hunk with its
  checkout bump and the hunk stopped applying once the template shipped v7 itself.
  `test_action_pins_are_consistent_and_current` now checks every action against
  `EXPECTED_ACTION_PINS` — it asserted only `checkout` while four other pins matched no repo
  alive, and stayed green throughout. The pins are current as of v0.25.1; when dependabot
  moves the fleet, move the template and that map together.

**Docs fail by rendering nothing.**
- **Every link this hook emits is unvalidated, and that is where the bugs live.** `--strict`
  checks markdown links; it never sees raw HTML a hook injects. Three separate defects hid
  there: the gallery overflow link 404'd into RTD-red; every root export's API-table Module
  cell pointed at `pages/api/`, a directory with no index; and See Also was linkified only
  on `pages/api/generated/`, so a curated page rendered its entries as plain text while the
  same names linked on generated pages. That last one is the shape to remember — **it works
  everywhere anyone looked**. Check these by fetching the rendered links yourself.
- An unresolved marker renders as blank space; `--strict` never validated it. `check_docs`
  (v0.21.2) makes marker warnings fatal — that job is the only reason any of this is caught.
- **Hook-emitted raw HTML is invisible to `--strict`** — mkdocs never validates links inside
  it. The gallery overflow link 404'd into RTD-red this way; API-table `Name`/`Module` links
  have the same exposure. Only RTD's `post_build` linkchecker sees them, and CI does not run it.
  **`check_docs` can pass while RTD goes red.**
- `_get_submodules` skips `_`-prefixed modules, which silently excludes `__init__.py` too,
  so a public symbol exported only from the package root belongs to no submodule and once
  reached no page (yohou-nixtla: 17 rows against 18 names in `__all__`). **FIXED** by
  `_get_root_members` in `docs/_api_pages.py`, called at both generation sites and covered by
  a test that asserts the fixture actually has a root export so it cannot pass vacuously.
  This entry said "unfixed template bug" for two releases after the fix landed, while the
  fleet table three sections up said the opposite — and I repeated the stale half into a PR
  body and an agent brief before checking the code. **A recorded defect is a claim with a
  date on it.** Re-measure before repeating one, especially from this file.
- `__gallery__` assigned inside an `@app.cell` is invisible — `ast.iter_child_nodes` only
  sees module level. Both of yohou-nixtla's notebooks were in no gallery at all, silently.

**Tooling lies.**
- **`gh pr edit` silently fails here** (GraphQL Projects-classic deprecation). Use
  `gh api -X PATCH repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/N -f title=... -F body=@file` and **read it back**.
- **A CONFLICTING PR runs no Actions.** "0 failures" out of ~1 check is meaningless.
- **`gh pr checks` does not accept `--json` on this machine** — it exits with
  `unknown flag: --json`. An earlier version of this file called it a *silent* empty return;
  re-measured, it is a hard error, and the "empty result" agents watched for ~10 minutes was
  their own script swallowing stderr. Use the plain text form. So "0 checks" has two real
  causes — a conflicting PR runs no Actions, and a swallowed error — and neither is a pass.
- **`gh pr checks` also exits NON-ZERO while checks are still pending.** A poll loop that
  guards on exit status breaks out immediately and reports the partial state as final; mine
  did, on this release. Guard on the *output* (`grep -q pending`), not the exit code.
- **`Validate Commit Message` skips on a multi-commit PR** — it carries
  `if: github.event.pull_request.commits == 1`. Folding a second release into an open PR
  flips it from pass to skip, which is correct, not a regression: with two commits GitHub
  takes the squash title from the **PR title**, which `pr-title.yml` validates instead.
  **This makes the PR title load-bearing for the changelog** — update it when you fold.
- **RTD 403s urllib's user-agent** — use `curl`.
- A stale `.rumdl_cache` gives a **false clean**. Delete it and re-run.
- Cached notebook exports (`.source_hash`) make a docs build **vacuous**. Clear
  `docs/examples/<stem>/` first — but never `rm -rf docs/examples`, which deletes a tracked
  `.gitkeep`.
- `git check-ignore` is silent for **tracked** files; use `--no-index` to test a rule.
- zsh does not word-split unquoted expansions — several "all clean" sweeps were empty-set
  bugs. Prefer Python over shell for any sweep whose result you intend to trust.
- **`grep -r --include=*.html` with the glob UNQUOTED returns 0 for everything.** zsh expands
  it against the *current directory* before grep sees it, so the filter matches nothing and
  every count comes back a confident zero. **Three separate agents hit this same line in the
  v0.28.1 round**, each on a different repo, each initially reporting a clean pass. All three
  caught it only from a stray "no matches found" on stderr. Quote the glob, or use Python.
  This is the single most repeated checker bug in the fleet's history — if a sweep reports
  zero, reproduce the zero against a deliberately injected instance before believing it.
- **Other sweep scoping traps from the same round**, all producing false all-clears: walking
  the whole repo and counting hits inside `.nox/` or `.venv/` site-packages (scope to
  `git ls-files`); comparing heading text without stripping Material's appended `¶`
  permalink; and an index-coverage check blind to a `<!-- SUBPAGES -->` marker the hook
  expands at build time, which read 0/5 on a page that is 5/5 in rendered HTML.

## 5. Verification discipline

**Falsify every check before trusting it.** In this fleet the checker is likelier to be
wrong than the code. Real examples, all of them a confident number over an empty set:
a See Also audit grepping `<h2>` when the markup is `<h3 id="see-also">`; a card counter
matching `gallery-card` when Material emits `grid cards`; a `tee | head` that SIGPIPE'd and
truncated the log *before the build ran*; a `pgrep` matching its own command line; a
readback that diffed an empty file because `gh` errored outside the repo.

**Measure the artifact that ships, not the one you edited.** A template defect lives in the
*rendered* file; the source can be correct and the render still wrong. v0.28.0 shipped four
overrides whose rendered form ended in a blank line, failing every generated project's
`end-of-file-fixer` and turning all seven repos red on one commit. It passed a 347-test
suite and my own pre-release verification, because every check read the source — which was
correctly one newline the whole time. I then "verified the fix" the same way and reported it
working when it was not in the tree at all.

The rule that would have caught it: **whenever a fix is about how something renders, the
check must open the rendered file.** And prefer a check that sweeps the whole rendered tree
over one that names the files you already suspect — the next instance will be elsewhere.
`tests/test_template.py::test_no_rendered_file_ends_in_a_blank_line` is that shape.

**A selector, glob, or guard that matches nothing is silent.** Three separate v0.28.0 defects
were of this kind: `h5.doc-section-heading` matched 0 elements after the class moved to an
inner span, so Material's default styling reasserted on 40 headings; `exclude_docs` had no
pattern for `.jinja`, so template source was served at 200; a `Methods` guard tested
`obj.members`, the pre-filter set, so 12 of 25 class pages got a heading introducing nothing.
None produced a warning and `--strict` saw none of them. **For anything expressed as a
pattern, count the matches on both sides** — how many elements have the class, how many files
the glob catches — and treat a zero as a failing measurement until proven otherwise.

**Copier renders a local template repo at its latest *tag*, not your working tree.** So
`copier copy /path/to/template` verifying an unreleased edit renders the *last release* and
reports, convincingly, that your change did nothing. This cost two wrong diagnoses in one
release: the fix was correct both times and the render was answering a different question.
`tests/conftest.py` passes `vcs_ref="HEAD"` for exactly this reason, and that form *does*
pick up uncommitted changes (that is what `DirtyLocalWarning` means — which the test suite
filters, so you will not see it). Pin `--vcs-ref` explicitly whenever you render.

**"Untouched" is not evidence.** If the template's render of a file is unchanged across the
version pair, it would have been untouched either way. Diff the pristine renders first
(§2.2); if identical, you have tested nothing.

**`copier update` does not recreate a locally-deleted file — *except* a skip-listed one,
which it recreates on every release.** `_skip_if_exists` means exactly what it says: skip
if it *exists*. Absent, copier copies it. v0.25.2 skip-listed `troubleshooting.md` to stop
it clobbering curated pages, and resurrected it in the three repos that had deleted or
renamed theirs — every update, forever, and where the stub's link target did not exist it
failed `--strict`. Three agents hit it independently; the control that settles it is same
baseline, same command, only the ref differs (v0.25.1 → not created, v0.25.2 → created).
An earlier version of this file stated the opposite, flatly, and it was wrong.

So skip-listing cuts both ways, and there is no copier setting that both protects a
curated page and respects its absence. When a page is wanted by some projects and unwanted
by others, the template should not ship it at all.

**Copier DELETES what the template removes.** Verified end to end: a customised 182-line
page was destroyed outright by a release that dropped it from the template. That is the
price of un-shipping something, and it is a one-time cost — a project restores its page
from git once, and the template then knows nothing about it, so no later update touches it
(also verified, on a run proven to have actually landed).

Because of the above, the delete-half of a two-way control **cannot** discriminate a
firing skip from a blind check. What does:
1. diff the pristine renders across the pair; identical ⇒ vacuous, and
2. **fork the template**, make a deliberate change to the file, update onto the fork, and
   confirm the customised file survives.
Binaries are the exception: copier rewrites them regardless of delta, so "the old version
overwrote it, the new one didn't" *is* a valid A/B on identical inputs.

**A deliberately narrow behaviour looks exactly like an incomplete fix.** Before reporting
a residue as a defect, read the function's docstring — in this repo the narrowness is
usually stated there. `_strip_redundant_section_titles` removes only the five section
titles the dispatcher maps to headings; `Yields`, `Warns` and friends keep theirs *on
purpose*, because that title is their only label. I briefed the v0.28.1 round with
"0 leftover `doc-section-title` spans" as a pass criterion, which is wrong: yohou correctly
keeps 10 and kedro-azureml keeps one (`Lifecycle`). Both agents refused to force the
number to zero and said why — the right call, and it means **a brief's acceptance criteria
are themselves claims to be checked**, not instructions to satisfy. Tell agents that
explicitly.

**Verify by rendering, not by reading.** Count in the built HTML, scoped to `<article>` —
the ToC sidebar inflates counts ~3×.
Do not derive See Also counts by splitting final HTML on newlines: mkdocstrings emits
multi-line `title=` attributes and the split cuts inside the tag, silently dropping entries.
**Never key a See Also audit on `<details class="see-also">`.** As of v0.28.0 there are
**zero** of them anywhere in a built site: the `admonition.html.jinja` override emits
`<div class="doc-section-item doc-admonition-see-also">` instead, and `hooks.py` matches on
that class. Zero hits reads as a clean pass and is total blindness. The stable anchor is a
heading with `id="see-also"`.

This line has been wrong in both directions across three releases: first "no container
survives" stated unconditionally (false — curated pages kept theirs); then "three shapes,
one of them `details.see-also`" (true when written, falsified by v0.28.0 changing the
markup out from under it). kedro-dagster's curated `pages/reference/datasets.md` was the
example cited for the surviving container and is now the example of the new `div` form.
**Do not encode the current markup here again.** Discover it: find the `id="see-also"`
headings, then read whatever container follows, whatever it is.

The shapes still differ in ways a single-shape counter gets wrong — `<ul><li>` lists,
bare `<p>` for single-entry sections, and a wrapping `div` — so a naive counter collapses
each list to one entry or misses whole sections. Three agents in one release each reported
a confident false count (15, 17, 15 "unlinked") before going shape-agnostic. **Write the
audit shape-agnostic and make it abort on zero rather than report all-clear.**

One more vacuous-check trap, found four times independently in one release: **testing
`T201` against `docs/hooks.py` proves nothing** — since the build steps moved out, that
file contains zero `print()` calls, so the rule cannot fire and every configuration looks
clean. Test a rule that actually fires in the file you are checking, and confirm with
`--isolated` that the ignore suppresses a real finding.

**Do NOT drive a headless browser for the DataTables filter.** An earlier version of this
file said to, and every agent that read it dutifully installed one — seven browsers per
release, to re-verify the same code. DataTables is **pinned at 2.2.2** and jQuery at 3.7.1
in `mkdocs.yml`, the init script is emitted by `hooks.py`, and `hooks.py` is Tier 1 and
already verified byte-identical everywhere. So the JS is pinned, template-owned and
identical in all seven repos. The `.dt-search` vs 1.x `#api-table_filter` incident that
produced that advice was agents using **1.x selectors against a 2.x pin** — a checker bug,
not a drift risk; the pin is the guard. Check it statically instead: `<table id="api-table">`
present, the init script emitted, the pinned CDN URLs returning 200 — and say plainly that
this does **not** prove the JS executes. That is the honest limit, and the right trade.
If the pin is ever bumped, that is when a real browser check earns its cost.

**`max_python_version` is not the interpreter constraint — `requires-python` is.** An
unpinned nox session takes the ambient interpreter, and whether that fails depends on the
project's `requires-python`, not on the answers file. yohou-nixtla (`>=3.11,<3.14`) failed
on a 3.14 machine; kedro-azureml-pipeline caps at `max_python_version: 3.13` in its answers
but has `>=3.11` with **no upper bound**, so the identical session ran fine on 3.14. Same
cap, opposite outcomes. `max_python_version` constrains `ALL_VERSIONS` and the classifiers;
it never reaches `uv sync`. Predicting one from the other produced a wrong brief once —
check the actual `requires-python` before claiming a session will fail.

**Prefer a no-op to churn.** If a repo already satisfies the change, say so plainly and
push nothing.

**A fan-out is the cheapest audit this fleet gets, and its findings are the point.** One
release's fan-out found four factual errors in *this file* — every one a claim an agent was
handed as fact and checked anyway. It also caught a bug in the release being shipped early
enough to fix upstream and fold into the same open PRs, so no repo ever carried a
workaround. **When an agent reports that this file is wrong, fix this file** — the next
release reads it.

## 6. Reporting

Require from each agent: the `docs/assets` diff **verbatim**; what each `.rej` held and how
it was resolved; per-page before→after with counts measured from rendered output; every
`check_docs` warning and its disposition; **how many CI checks RAN** and whether
"Docs build (strict)" passed; RTD state fetched with curl; and anything they could not
verify, flagged rather than asserted.

Tell them explicitly: **if a warning reveals a template bug rather than a repo bug, report
it and do not work around it locally** — a local patch to a Tier 1 file drifts forever and
undoes the fork elimination. Collect those, and cut a template release instead.

That instruction works, and it costs something. In the v0.28.0 round it split the fleet:
two repos left CI red and reported the bug; four normalised locally to go green and
disclosed it; the honest red ones were the more useful signal, and every local fix then had
to be reverted when v0.28.1 landed. **Say which you want.** Leaving it red is right when the
defect is fleet-wide and a fix is coming in the same session; patching locally is only worth
it when the repo would otherwise block on something unrelated.

## 7. Git hygiene for agents

- **`git add -A` FIRST, then run prek, then `git add -A` again.** prek only sees git-tracked
  files, so running it before staging silently skips every new file a release introduces —
  lint passes locally, and CI goes red on the exact files the release added. This fired in
  the v0.28.0 round; one agent caught it only from `gh pr create`'s "uncommitted changes"
  warning, after committing the pre-fix copies.
- **Never amend a pushed commit and never force-push.** An agent in the v0.28.0 round
  amended and `--force-with-lease`'d its own PR branch to correct the mistake above. The
  result was fine and the reasoning was sound, but it rewrote history other people and other
  agents may already have fetched, without anyone authorising it. Add a new commit instead;
  a slightly messy branch is cheaper than rewritten shared history.
- **Never `git stash` to park work.** `git stash --keep-index && git stash drop` destroyed a
  set of edits in this repo — the drop is unrecoverable and there is no confirmation. Commit
  to a scratch branch, or copy files aside.
- **Push to the existing branch; do not open a second PR.** These are long-lived
  `template-update/*` PRs that advance across releases.
