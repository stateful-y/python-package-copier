"""End-to-end guards for the documentation engine (Zensical).

These build a generated project's docs through the same ``build_docs`` nox
session a contributor and CI run, and assert on the *rendered HTML*, not on the
build's exit status. That distinction is the whole point: the failure modes this
migration had to survive -- page-context markers silently rendering empty, and
build tooling leaking into the site -- both pass a green ``--strict`` build. A
test that trusts the exit code would not catch either.

``build_docs`` runs Zensical (the maintained successor to Material for MkDocs).
If these fail with an *empty* site on a developer machine, suspect exhausted
inotify instances rather than a real regression: the engine's file collector
needs them even for a one-shot build. See the contributor guide. CI runs in a
fresh environment and is unaffected.
