"""Tests for the See Also Griffe extension (`docs_build/_see_also.py`).

The extension rewrites numpydoc "See Also" blocks into markdown cross-references
at Griffe collection time, before mkdocstrings renders the docstring. It replaces
the HTML post-processing the docs hooks used to do (`_linkify_see_also`), which
reached into rendered HTML and was fragile against changes in mkdocstrings'
output shape. These tests drive the extension through a real Griffe load and
assert on the rewritten docstring; one test builds the docs and checks that
autorefs resolves the references into links.
